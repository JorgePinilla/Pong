# Pong
A work in progress version of the game Pong.

The following files should be in the same folder:

      -Gui.java
   
      -Entity.java
   
      -Target.java
   
      -DrawPanel.java

To run the simulator use the following command: (make sure files have been compiled)
      java Gui
      
The players paddle is on the left (as usual). Use up and down arrow keys to move your paddle.

Things to be done:

      -Improve collisions
    
      -Improve opposing paddle AI
    
      -Add start menu
    
      -Add player 2
